# Environment variables are not set as expected

It seems that environment variables, e.g. `DATABASE_PORT`, are not set correctly
when

1. Using Docker integration
2. Having a `.env` file in the project root folder setting
   `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` to *something different from the project root folder
   name*
3. Using the `php` sub-command to run a file in a sub-folder to the project root
   folder

See <https://github.com/symfony-cli/symfony-cli/issues/20>.

## Steps to reproduce

```sh
./test.sh
```
